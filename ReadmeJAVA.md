# Java Notes

### Process of execution in Java 

* JVM is Java Virtual Machine, JVM executed the bytecode generated by compiler aka it is the interpreter for MacOS, Windows and Linux; Javac is the primary java compiler included in JDK (Java Development Kit)
* Extention is .java and then it is compiled into bytecode as output.
* JDK compiles the program into bytecode as output with .class extention.
* JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 


### JRE, JDK

* JRE is the environment within which the java virtual machine runs. 
* JDK is the superset of JRE, it contains everything that JRE has along with development tools such as compiler, debugger etc.
